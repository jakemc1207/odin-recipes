# What I Did
I created a basic website that links a recipes page. After that, I added two recipes, both links of which are clickable. In the footer, I added the original source. 

# Sources I Used
I used the [The Odin Project(www.theodinproject.com)] and VS Code. I used [All Recipes(www.allrecipes.com)] for the recipes in this project

# Acknowledgments
Thank you to The Odin Project for helping me learn about web structure and development. While it was not the best looking website, you have really helped me understand the code used as well. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
